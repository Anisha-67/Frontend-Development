Digital Clock:

In this project, i have  created a simple digital clock that displays the current time in hours,minutes, and seconds, updating every second.
This is built using HTML,CSS,Javascript.
This project helped me understand the basics of JavaScript for dynamic updates and CSS for styling a user interface. 
Itâ€™s a great introduction to working with the Date object, setInterval function, and basic DOM manipulation.


Extra features added by me:
  Display: Show the current date along with the time.
  Styling Effects: Applied CSS animations to make the clock more visually engaging.
  Added Dark/Light Mode: Implemented a toggle to switch between dark and light modes.
